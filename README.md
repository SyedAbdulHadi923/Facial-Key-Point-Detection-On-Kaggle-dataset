# Facial-Key-Point-Detection-On-Kaggle-dataset


Nowadays, facial keypoints detection has become a very popular topic and it's applications include Snapchat and other social media application such as realistic avetor . The objective of facial keypoints detection is to find the facial keypoints in a given face, which is very challenging due to very different facial features from person to person. The idea of deep learning has been applied to this problem, such as neural network. After completion of this project, you will understand that a deep neural network can effectively and efficiently solve the facial keypoints detection problem.

You can dowonload the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data). Go to the link and click **Download All** at the bottom. **The train dataset has 7049 images and for each of images you will have to predict 15 facial keypoints.** Since each of these points have x and y cordinates, I have predicted predict 30 points in total using CNN Model.
